# Wake Word Detection
**About Project**

Always-on spoken language interfaces, e.g. personal digital assistants, rely on a wake word to start processing spoken input. Novel methods are proposed to train a wake word detection system from partially labeled training data, and to use it in on-line applications.

In this project, we will construct a speech dataset, implement an algorithm for wake word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or trigger word detection) and provide a base for real time demo.

* Wake word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple Siri to wake up upon hearing a certain word.
* For this project, our trigger word will be "Activate". We can also use any other word (with atleast 3 syllables) like computer, assistant etc., by following the same process. Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
* By the end of this project, we will be able to record a clip of ourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a function when it detects us saying "activate."
* In continuation of this project, perhaps we can also extend it to run on your laptop so that every time you say "activate" it starts up your favorite app, or turns on a network connected lamp in your house, or triggers some other event?

In this project we will:
- Structure a speech recognition project
- Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
- Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
- Use the model for real time demonstration
